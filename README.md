# [S&P500: Stock Data Cleaning & Dashboard Creation]

This is a project I did with the intention of creating a PowerBI dashboard, which would be useful for comparing stocks.

* Data was fetched using Python with the help of ChatGPT.
* Fetched data was cleaned and organized using SQL and Excel.
* In addition SQL queries were used for calculating financial ratios such as P/E and D/E.
* PowerBI was used for vizualising data and creating an environment for quick and easy comparison.
