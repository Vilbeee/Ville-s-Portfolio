# [Fitness Project: Python Data Cleaning & Visualization]
I use Python to analyze and visualize questionnaire answers on fitness wearables.

- Python was used to fetch data from a local file.
- Data was cleaned only using Python.
- Visualization using likert scale plots and bar graphs.
- Short descriptive analysis on the results.

## Full project can be found in the .ipybnb File
